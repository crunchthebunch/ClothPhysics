Double-click the ClothPhysics.exe to launch the demo

Use WASD to move the camera in the demo.

Hover over objects and/or the cloth and click and hold to pick them up. A 'Pick Up' text appears to help you discern if the object can be picked up. 
Moving the camera while holding moves the objects around.

The cube, sphere and capsule objects are thrown after they are held. The cloth can be held, and the camera can be moved away to 'tear' the cloth.

The hairdryer object emits a constant wind forcein the inward z-direction. If brought closer to the cloth, the cloth will react accordingly to the wind force. The hairdryer
object cannot be thrown.

The size of the cloth as well as the amount of wind force can be changed from the 'settings.ini' file. The current settings are the default settings. Windforce values are
very sensitive to try at your own risk.

Press 'R' to reset the cloth and the objects in the level.
